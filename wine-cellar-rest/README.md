# PA165 Wine Cellar - REST module guide

## Install

Run server by command:

```
mvn tomcat7:run
```

**Note:** If your default port (8080) is occupied e.g. by web server you can run rest module in different port by using

```
mvn -Dmaven.tomcat.port=XXXX tomcat7:run  
```
*(XXXX is port)* </br>

**Note 2:** If you use the Windows commandline you should adjust commands because of escaping
